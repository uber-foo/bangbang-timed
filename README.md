This crate provides an implementation of a [bang-bang controller] that can optionally
constrain state transitions by enforcing a minimum-time-in-state. Suitable for regular
applications using the standard library and embedded applications using [no_std].

Bang-bang controllers are relatively simple machines, able to flip-flop solely between two
mutually exclusive states. A common example of a bang-bang controller is a thermostatâ€”the
furnace can be turned either on or off with no other states of operation between those two
extremes. A bang-bang that enforces a minimum operating time at each state could help
ensure that the furnace does not cycle too frequently which could damge or reduce its lifespan.

# Example
```rust
use bangbang::prelude::*;

// Simple struct to hold our current state
struct FlipFlop {
    current_state: BangBangState,
}

// Simplest implementation of a bang-bang controller
impl BangBang for FlipFlop {
    // Return the current active state
    fn state(&self) -> BangBangState {
        self.current_state
    }
    
    // Change the current active state
    fn set(&mut self, new_state: BangBangState) -> Result<(), BangBangError> {
        // Normally there would be logic here to ensure a state transition is possible

        // For the example, we'll just simply change the state as requested
        self.current_state = new_state;

        // No failure cases in this example
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn run_example() -> Result<(), BangBangError> {
    // Create a new bang-bang controller with initial state set to `A`
    let mut flip_flop = FlipFlop { current_state: BangBangState::A };
    assert_eq!(flip_flop.state(), BangBangState::A);

    // Trigger the bang-bang controller, flipping the state to `B`
    flip_flop.bang()?;
    assert_eq!(flip_flop.state(), BangBangState::B);

    // Trigger the bang-bang controller, flipping the state back to `A`
    flip_flop.bang()?;
    assert_eq!(flip_flop.state(), BangBangState::A);

    Ok(())
}

run_example();
```
